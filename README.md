Flask Modular System Overview

I am developing a modular Flask system aimed at serving as the foundation for more complex future systems. The goal is to build a flexible and scalable solution that can be easily customized and extended with additional features.
Current Features

APIs:

    Login: Authenticates users into the system.
    Logout: Logs users out of the system.
    Retrieve (single): Retrieves data for a single record.
    Retrieve (multiple): Retrieves data for multiple records.
    Update: Updates records in the system.
    Delete: Deletes records from the system.
    Send Email: Sends automated or manual emails via the system.

Screens:

    AJAX Screens: Allows for asynchronous interactions without refreshing the entire page.
    Jinja Template Screens: Utilizes Jinja for server-side rendering of web pages.
    Registration Screens: Screens for user registration, providing a user-friendly interface.
    Buttons: Interactive elements to trigger actions (e.g., submit, update, delete).

Configuration:

    The system has a configuration file that allows easy renaming of the system. This feature ensures that the system can be deployed under different project names without complex changes to the codebase.

Modular Structure:

    Functions are separated into modules, ensuring a clean, maintainable codebase. Each module serves a specific purpose, promoting a modular design that can be expanded easily.

ORM Models:

    The system utilizes ORM models to handle interactions with the database, simplifying query operations and making it easier to manage complex relationships between entities.

Remaining Tasks

1. Database Enhancements:

    I plan to enhance the database by adding more fields to the user_details table. This will include additional columns like first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, roles, and other relevant fields, depending on the system's requirements.
    Proper relational models will also be established to maintain data integrity and manage relationships between tables, such as user roles and permissions.

2. Password Security Controls:

    The current system allows any password to be used during registration, which poses a security risk. I will implement password hashing using libraries such as Werkzeug or bcrypt to securely store user passwords.
    Additionally, I will enforce password strength validation, ensuring that users create strong passwords (e.g., minimum length, use of special characters, uppercase, etc.).

Additional Considerations

To further improve the security and functionality of the system, I plan to implement:

    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to provide an extra layer of security for users.
    API Authentication using JWT or OAuth to secure API endpoints and prevent unauthorized access.
    User activity logging to track user actions within the system, such as failed login attempts, password changes, and other important events.
